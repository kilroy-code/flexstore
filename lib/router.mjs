  POKE DESIGN
  Clients may post their platform push subscriptions to us. For those that do, we push a message that wakes them up
  (so that they can connect, synchronize, and optionally give the user message-specific OS notifications).

  Goal: Update users within 20 minutes of activity. (Apple says we shouldn't send more than 2 or 3 an hour.)
  - No push if client already connected.
  - No push if no activity for them to synchronize.

  Subscription is managed by a per-device GUID that is not tied to user tags in any way.
  Relay does not examine specific activity (e.g, what groups have activity), as we don't want to relays to know a user's groups.
  Push to all who need it at once, so that server is not maintaining timers per client.

  1. On any activity, if there is no live timer, push to subscribers that are not connected, and start a timer.
  2. If there is a live timer, do nothing. (E.g., do not start a new one).
  3. When a timer goes off, push to subscribers that are not connected.
     - There is no queue of undelivered data. Any data since the timer was started will be synchronized by clients when they connect.
     - Clients may have been synchronized when the initial data triggered the timer, and then gone offline. That client will have a dry sync.
