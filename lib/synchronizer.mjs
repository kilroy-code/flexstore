/*
  Responsible for keeping a collection synchronized with another peer.
  (Peers may be a client or a server/relay. Initially this is the same code either way,
  but later on, optimizations can be made for scale.)

  As long as two peers are connected with a Synchronizer on each side, writing happens
  in both peers in real time, and reading produces the correct synchronized result from either.
  Under the hood, the synchronizer keeps track of what it knows about the other peer --
  a particular tag can be unknown, unsynchronized, or synchronized, and reading will
  communicate as needed to get the data synchronized on-demand. Meanwhile, synchronization
  continues in the background until the collection is fully replicated.

  A collection maintains a separate Synchronizer for each of zero or more peers, and can dynamically
  add and remove more.
