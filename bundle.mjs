/*
  Responsible for keeping a collection synchronized with another peer.
  (Peers may be a client or a server/relay. Initially this is the same code either way,
  but later on, optimizations can be made for scale.)

  As long as two peers are connected with a Synchronizer on each side, writing happens
  in both peers in real time, and reading produces the correct synchronized result from either.
  Under the hood, the synchronizer keeps track of what it knows about the other peer --
  a particular tag can be unknown, unsynchronized, or synchronized, and reading will
  communicate as needed to get the data synchronized on-demand. Meanwhile, synchronization
  continues in the background until the collection is fully replicated.

  A collection maintains a separate Synchronizer for each of zero or more peers, and can dynamically
  add and remove more.

  Naming conventions:

  mumbleName: a semantic name used externally as a key. Example: serviceName, channelName, etc.
    When things need to match up across systems, it is by name.
    If only one of name/label is specified, this is usually the the one.

  mumbleLabel: a label for identification and internally (e.g., database name).
    When two instances of something are "the same" but are in the same Javascript image for testing, they are distinguished by label.
    Typically defaults to mumbleName.

  Note, though, that some external machinery (such as a WebRTC DataChannel) has a "label" property that we populate with a "name" (channelName).
